## Your Task
    
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Because this application won‚Äôt be deployed, you‚Äôll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You‚Äôll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.
